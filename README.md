# Art-of-the-Deal.The-peoples-card-collection
Art of the Deal, the people's card collection, is a balatro mod that adds a few of my own ideas, alongside any idea that a person that either doesn't know how to code, can't figure it out, or simply doesn't want to, and wants their ideas in the game.

How you can suggest an addition:
On the balatro discord, I have a forum post labeled 'Art of the Deal - (bunch of other description stuff)', in which you can suggest anything to your hearts content, provided that...
1. you can provide art of at least decent quality (even if you dont think your art is good enough, try anyways!)
it must also follow the balatro styleguides (which can be found in #fan-art on the discord) to the best of your ability, 
but I ask you at least maintain the correct size of cards (69 by 93 px for jokers), and try to go no darker than 'balatro black' which is #4f6367
2. You can preferably provide me a basic description of what you want it to do, though this is optional if push comes to shove

List of joker additions (this probably wont ever be adjusted past the first twenty jokers)
1. Atraxia, increases in Xmult every round you dont buy something, resets when you spend money, by me
2. Punchcard, rounds chips and mult *up* to the nearest power of two, by me
3. Jooj, jooj, art and concept by JinFlux
4. Laughing Joker, gives mult, mult increases for every face card played, art and concept by KoLGames

Version history + roadmap

V1.0 initial release, 20 jokers

V1.1 adds 10 new jokers, and also moves some of the jokers around in the collection to put each artists' jokers next to each other to the best of my ability

V1.1.1 'pissbaby' -might fix the fucking mimic joker

--Upcoming--

V1.2 plans on adding 6 new decks to the game

V2.0 will have joker submissions reopened, along with a few slots for consumables/vouchers/etc, will take a while before that happens as i will be working on a personal project before then
