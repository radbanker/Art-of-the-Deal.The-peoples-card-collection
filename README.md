# Art-of-the-Deal.The-peoples-card-collection
Art of the Deal, the people's card collection, is a balatro mod that adds a few of my own ideas, alongside any idea that a person that either doesn't know how to code, can't figure it out, or simply doesn't want to, and wants their ideas in the game.

How you can suggest an addition:
On the balatro discord, I have a forum post labeled 'Art of the Deal - (bunch of other description stuff)', in which you can suggest anything to your hearts content, provided that...
a. you can provide art of at least decent quality (even if you dont think your art is good enough, try anyways!)
  i. it must also follow the balatro styleguides (which can be found in #fan-art on the discord) to the best of your ability, 
     but I ask you at least maintain the correct size of cards, and try to go no darker than 'balatro black'
